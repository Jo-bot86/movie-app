# movie-app

In this tutorial we create a movie-application from scratch using the MERN-stack.
You can find the tutorial inside docs.

In case you want just clone this repo, you find all the necessary dependencies inside `docs/intro.md`.

This tutorial is still not ready. I will add parts of it from time to time and I'm happy about comments, hints or advice.
